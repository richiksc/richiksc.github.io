This is a simple refresh button component that I built I while ago using [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) 0.5. Polymer was still in its early days, not production ready at all, and I was obsessed with web components. *Please* do not use this component. I built a simple component trying out the new `paper-spinner` element, and I thought at that time somebody else might like to use it. Nobody ever wants to use a nascent technology, but hey, it's a custom element!
